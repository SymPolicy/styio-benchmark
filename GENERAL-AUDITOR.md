# General-Auditor

CI uses `Unka-Malloc/General-Auditor@only` and audits this repository only.
The native `styio-audit` status context is retained where branch protection requires it.
Keyword findings are advisory and require contextual review by the contributor's local Agent.

For local checks, use a trusted checkout of General-Auditor's `only` branch and set
`GENERAL_AUDITOR_ROOT` to that checkout. The local scope commands require the
scope implementation from [General-Auditor PR #1](https://github.com/Unka-Malloc/General-Auditor/pull/1).
Do not fetch or execute Auditor code from a contributor's branch.

```sh
python3 -I "$GENERAL_AUDITOR_ROOT/action_entry.py" scan \
  --policy-root "$GENERAL_AUDITOR_ROOT" --repository "SymPolicy/styio-benchmark" \
  --directory . --scope staged --output "$(git rev-parse --git-path general-auditor/staged.json)"
```

Use `--scope worktree` for tracked and nonignored untracked working files,
`--scope history` for all commits reachable from HEAD, or `--scope range --base <commit>`
for outgoing commits. Reports remain under Git's private metadata directory;
review redacted findings with the local Agent before publishing. A successful
scanner exit is not a contextual privacy approval. Configuration failures fail the command.
Existing application checks and delivery schedulers remain independent.
